## Summary

Get an overview of 1) the module, 2) remote sensing as a field, and 3) Elizabeth's journey integrating field ecology with remote sensing imagery (with no geospatial background); read/discuss LaRue et al.
and discuss/brainstorm project ideas. 

## Goals

* Develop an understanding of remote sensing as a field and some ways it can be used in marine science
* Start to visualise how you may be able to harness the power of geospatial data in your work
* Start thinking about geospatial-relevent ?s to ask/answer in a) course project and b) your own research

## Components

* Introduction to the module and overview of what we'll do in it
* Overview of remote sensing as a field (lecture)
* Questions/brief discussion
* Case study integrating behavioural field ecology and remote sensing (lecture)
* Reading of LaRue et al. (2016) Conservation Biology
* Brainstorming/discussing project ideas
* Writing out three potential project topics each

## Discussion points & questions

#### LaRue et al. (2016) Con. Biol.

* Not just relevant to wildlife obaservation - also relevant to habitat features (e.g., grazing features; coastal land loss; etc.)
* Useful paper because farily non-technical, but conveys key technical points considerations/limitations

* Based on the criteria they give, can you think of other types of animals/habitats that are a) well-suited b) not well-suited to this type of analysis?
* Can you think of something in your own system (or work or interest) that could be measured by VHR satellite imagery?
* What factors might affect the liklihood of getting accurate results for such analyses?
    + e.g., the way the detection probability of Weddell seals was affected by sea ice conditions

* **GOAL**: write down 2-3 things (animals, features, processes, etc.) that you could measure in your system (or beyond) that might be expected to change over time and/or over space
    + Do they require ground-truthing?
    + What potential issues can you foresee?
