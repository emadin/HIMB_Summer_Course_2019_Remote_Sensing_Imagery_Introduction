## Summary

Get an overview of 1) the module, 2) remote sensing as a field, and 3) Elizabeth's journey integrating field ecology with remote sensing imagery (with no geospatial background); read/discuss LaRue et al.
and discuss/brainstorm project ideas. 

## Goals

* Develop an understanding of remote sensing as a field and some ways it can be used in marine science
* Start to visualise how you may be able to harness the power of geospatial data in your work
* Start thinking about geospatial-relevent ?s to ask/answer in a) course project and b) own research

## Components

* Introduction to the module and overview of what we'll do in it
* Overview of remote sensing as a field (lecture)
* Discussion
* Case study integrating behavioural field ecology and remote sensing (lecture)
* Reading of LaRue et al. (2016) Conservation Biology
* Brainstorming/discussing project ideas
* Writing out three potential project topics each
