Summary
-------

Get an overview of 1) the module, 2) remote sensing as a field, and 3) Elizabeth's journey integrating field ecology with remote sensing imagery (with no geospatial background); read/discuss LaRue et al. and discuss/brainstorm project ideas.

Goals
-----

-   Develop an understanding of remote sensing as a field and some ways it can be used in marine science
-   Start to visualise how you may be able to harness the power of geospatial data in your work
-   Start thinking about geospatial-relevent ?s to ask/answer in a) course project and b) own research

Components
----------

-   Introduction to the module and overview of what we'll do in it
-   Overview of remote sensing as a field (lecture)
-   Discussion
-   Case study integrating behavioural field ecology and remote sensing (lecture)
-   Reading of LaRue et al. (2016) Conservation Biology
